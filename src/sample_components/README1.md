*For the Members*: You can add your sample files here. No restrictio in the stack implementation, whether React.js or Vanilla(Normal) JS with HTML and CSS. Make sure the UI works.

For the Members I've assigned any UI or component to work a sample on, you can upload it here.
Those who wish to do it in React with JS, can create a separate branch for their development and rendering and add your sample component into the App.js 
and give a demonstration.

For those submitting in HTML CSS and JS, make sure your template works in Live server. The project is already deployed 
so create a sample staging branch for solo development and testing.

For roles to be done, refer ot the ACEXplore project's ToDo list that I've given access to. If any doubts, will always be here so not to worry.
